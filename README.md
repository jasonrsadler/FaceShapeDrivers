# FaceShapeDrivers
Script that allows facial expressions and visemes on Adobe Fuse CC created characters.

<h2>Known Issues</h2>

This is a rough alpha version and a proof of concept only. Clean up and optimization will follow. It is tested and works with characters created in Adobe Fuse CC and rigged using the Mixamo auto-rigger with BlendShapes added. It is untested for characters created and rigged through Mixamo Fuse 1.3.

Currently BlendShape names are hardcoded. Updates will grab the BlendShape names from the SkinnedMeshRenderer.
