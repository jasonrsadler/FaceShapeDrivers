# FaceShapeDrivers
Script that allows facial expressions and visemes on Adobe Fuse CC created characters.

DEPRECATED - As of late 2020, Mixamo's servers no longer export blendshapes with characters -

<h2>Known Issues</h2>

This is a rough alpha version and a proof of concept only. It is tested and works with characters created in Adobe Fuse CC and rigged using the Mixamo auto-rigger with BlendShapes added. It is untested for characters created and rigged through Mixamo Fuse 1.3.

Currently BlendShape names are hardcoded. Updates will grab the BlendShape names from the SkinnedMeshRenderer.

<h2>Example</h2>
